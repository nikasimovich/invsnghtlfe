                    <p>Dearest Brendan,</p>
                    <p>California is hot. And it has earthquakes, fires, and endless traffic on the 405. But all of this will be worth it when you‚Äôre not flying red eyes to teach a day of class and can come home to your family. A little change is good and Otis is lucky to have you at the helm. New York will always have a special place in our journey.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for all the phone calls checking in on my sanity, for quickly answering emails when I didn&rsquo;t know where a file was, and for reminding me why we do this crazy thing of teaching.</p> 
                    <p>Three wishes for you:
                        <ul>
                            <li>May all your pizzas be delivered to the right place and time.</li>
                            <li>May you get a faculty team who are as smart, hardworking, and inspiring as at Parsons.</li> 
                            <li>And lastly, may you get a chance to breathe and take it in once your boxes are unpacked ‚Äî look at the hot pink sunset and say you‚Äôre home.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Sending love from the UK,</p>

                    <p>You will be greatly missed, and Parsons CD won‚Äôt be the same without you! I‚Äôve always appreciated your sense of humor and sharp &ldquo;positive sarcasm&rdquo; in and outside of meetings.</p>
                    <p>I hope life brings you back to New York ‚Äî or even better, to Cologne, so we can end the workday at 3pm with a celebratory beer.</p>
                    <p>Be well and stay in touch!</p>

Thank you for being the best colleague and for your support this past year. I will keep you posted on the absurdities that will continue to occur here so don‚Äôt worry about feeling left out.

                    <p>From ten years ago, when I sat in my first Core Interaction meeting with you as the coordinator, until last year, at our Visual Culture Seminar final crit at Squarespace with you as the MC ‚Äî you‚Äôve been the same: constantly championing other people and making good things happen. It‚Äôs been a pleasure teaching alongside you and I‚Äôm grateful for all your support. Wishing you the sickest audio setup and an unlimited woven lanyard budget. You better let us know when your tour dates drop.</p>

                    <p>Congratulations on your new appointment at Otis! You are well positioned to be in this new post and I can imagine the new ideas you will be implementing there. Good luck with your move to ‚ÄúSoCal‚Äù and warm wishes to Azusa and your boys as you get adjusted to your new environment. I‚Äôll be in touch when my travels take me to your fair city. Many members of the Tenazas clan are based there so I‚Äôll have other reasons to visit! Good luck!</p>

                    <p>I‚Äôm soo thankful that I got to work alongside you these last seven years. I have learned so much from you as a colleague and am grateful that I can now call you a good friend. From seeing your gamer mouse, crazy keyboard, insane sneakers to your bright orange <span class="author">MPS CD</span> lanyard, getting to sit next to you in the <span class="author">AMT</span> hub has been a special treat. For all the jokes cracked while getting down in the trenches to help shape the <span class="author">CD</span> program into what it has become today, you have left your mark here at Parsons without a doubt. Lastly, your support this year has been everything. I am sooo excited for my next trip out to Los Angeles and I wish you best of luck as you start this new chapter at Otis!</p>

                        You will be missed (you are already missed) in our hallowed halls (üòÇ) but you will be a friend and colleague forever. I think you and the fam are going to get the best of <span class="author">LA</span>, and I can‚Äôt wait to visit and see all the places you‚Äôve discovered there. 
                        I‚Äôm so grateful for the last ten years in more ways than I can count. You were always the person who said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs do it‚Äù and ‚Äúhow hard can it be‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there‚Äù and dealt with some super gnarly situations with more humor and grace than I could deliver. I know you‚Äôre going to be a great leader at Otis - they are super lucky to have you.
