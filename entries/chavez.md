Of the events that led to her confinement she can only speculate: Had the three-legged stools the nightclub stored beneath the DJ booth been any color but the black that matched the darkness perhaps she’d be free—chastised for trespassing, yes, and steered out to the street—but free.

Had she only left a trace of her presence above, a bottle or a handbag set like bait beside the decks, perhaps a barback would have seen her trembling shadow and removed her from this self-made isolation. Had she been clumsier, drunker, slower to catch the fire extinguisher she knocked over, the echo of metal on plywood would have revealed her to security, whose impatient glance around the curtained dance floor could not discern her.

What froze her to the spot, she wondered, what instinct kept her still and quiet against the promise of detection? She felt no thrill, no slick pleasure in her trespass, no fear even but rather the strange tranquility of having discovered an unmarked cave by a familiar sea. The star-shaped earring her boyfriend wanted back lured her under, its broken clasp a fated beckoning to the sticky cables and hardened limes beneath the DJ booth at Amulet.

Amulet had been her first Bushwick night club and had incubated her party, now a collective, Paradise Vision, before it blew up and had to move to a bigger venue. Returning to play at Amulet again felt like a kind of homecoming. She was only twenty the first time she played here. One of the bartenders had found her Jill Scott bootleg and budots remixes on SoundCloud and snuck her in through the back to play his fundraiser for GLITS — the Gays and Lesbians Living in a Transgender Society.

That night she had waited in the alleyway, clutching the USB in her pocket in a fist, worried it’d disappear somehow and she’d have nothing to offer.

She was motioned in with a side hug, and though her patron spoke in her ear the music was so loud from the monitors that she barely caught a thing. The crowd fixed their eyes upon her, standing there behind the pulpit-like booth. The DJ blended in a new beat and the crowd returned their attention to the music as she faded into the tableau, as obvious and commonplace as the exit sign behind her.

That’s when she noticed them: the twenty-two faces of the major arcanum painted large and looming on the ruddy red walls surrounding her. The figures were obscured by the speakers, or bisected by the limbs of the pulsing crowd. Beside her the fog machine hissed to life. House lights refracted off the drifting mist, stretching her attention towards corners of the pictures that, for a moment, were hidden — a chain to nowhere, a lone wrist, a floating pitcher — then revealed — the length of a sword, an exact roman numeral, a brilliant star — just like the earring she’d lost.

Kneeling there, hiding beneath the booth for hours, surrounded by those same walls in the silent dark, the memory of her first night at Amulet emerged from the mud of her mind. All she could sweat had by now steeped into her clothes, the bodysuit bowing like a hangnail. She looked onto the deserted dance floor and saw the tarot as she did that first night: symbols emerging, fading into narrative, and revealing the tale of her eternal night.

She saw herself in the High Priestess. Sitting before her, staring out from the walls with the same patient expression as the eyes of the crowd. What does she have to give, she wondered, what token would pull the curtain aside, and show her the priestess’ secrets.

No, she realized, flicking the USB open and closed in her pocket. The High Priestess was not guarding the secret. She was the secret. And in exchange for her dedication, the priestess will open a path for her.

It’s the right path, she nods to herself, as the dazzling rays of The Sun come into view. She could be a guiding light.

Towards what, she asks, releasing her eye to find their answer. She laughs to herself, giddy from the heights of resonance. The scales of Justice fill her vision. She sees it now: to be free and safe.

The howling of the dogs is a freedom of a different kind. A freedom of the blood. Of movement, of The Moon. Of the light that lights up the night. And offers, Here: Be free here. Let the heartbeat take shape.

Behold the shape, she instructs, and The Tower makes itself known. Or rather, the bolt of lightning that strikes the tower and sets empire aflame declares itself her tool to wield.

She knows what this will make her. The thorned wing of The Devil in the arcanum previous tells her all she needs to know. She’ll be a curator of the underworld, like Moloch or Baphomet to those unaware of the slack of their shackles.

Who am I really, she asks. Unmoored by her image, she needs to know her role in the ceaseless nights that, like turns of a carousel, renew the ride.

In the space between the symbol for infinity and the crown of The Magician’s head she saw herself, dwelling there, where the creative spark is caught, smithed, and made to last.

Crouched beneath the decks she has become the priestess that her vision foretold. Abbess of Amulet, Mother of the House of Paradise.
