  const paragraphs = ["The silence of night was eerie, almost deafening. It always unnerved me—the stillness of night. Hearing the unfiltered sounds of my surroundings made me feel disoriented, like I was hallucinating. Maybe it was paranoia or anxiety, but my wired headphones helped. Even with the world drowned out, I knew better than to let my guard down completely.","“Get home safe,” people said. Like a blessing, a command, or a wish. But the words felt heavy on my mind, walking home under a dark sky with empty streets and cold air biting at my skin. I don’t think I know what it really means to be safe. My headphones played quietly, my steps soft. Sometimes, I wonder if my safety is something I have control over, or if “get home safe” is nothing more than a conditional formality. Something that we tell each other to show care and politeness.","On nights like the one I’m describing,music isn’t for listening—it’s for silencing. The soft hum in my ears blurred the outside world, making it easier to stay within my thoughts. I kept the volume low, not out of courtesy, but caution. If I couldn’t hear what was behind me, how could I know I was alone? The music wasn’t always entertainment—it was armor.","Two blocks from home, I saw a shadow on the ground that wasn’t mine. I paused my music. The sound of footsteps emerged behind me—soft, steady, and wrong. I didn’t look, but my pace quickened. Someone was there. My hands curled into fists inside my pockets, and my chest tightened. I was no longer walking alone.","What does it mean to feel unsafe? Sometimes it’s not a monster—it’s a pace behind you that matches yours. It’s the feeling of being watched or followed. I felt the cold metal of my house keys in my pocket and gripped onto them. Every footstep from behind felt louder than my own heartbeat.  “Get home safe.”","Then—nothing. No footsteps, no shadows. Just stillness so thick it made my ears ring. I looked once, twice. The street was bare. Empty pavement. Nothing was there. And yet, the feeling in my chest did not subside. Was that real? What happened?","I turned the final corner and saw my house waiting at the end of the block. My hand tightened harder around the key, leaving a red indent mark in my palm. Even on the doorstep, I checked behind me one more time. The street was still empty, but the unease remained. I stepped inside, locked the door, and stood still in the dark hallway. I was home safe—for now"];
