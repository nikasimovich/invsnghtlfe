  - The silence of night was eerie, almost deafening. It always unnerved me—the stillness of night. Hearing the unfiltered sounds of my surroundings made me feel disoriented, like I was hallucinating. Maybe it was paranoia or anxiety, but my wired headphones helped. Even with the world drowned out, I knew better than to let my guard down completely. 
  - “Get home safe,” people said. Like a blessing, a command, or a wish. But the words felt heavy on my mind, walking home under a dark sky with empty streets and cold air biting at my skin. I don’t think I know what it really means to be safe. My headphones played quietly, my steps soft. Sometimes, I wonder if my safety is something I have control over, or if “get home safe” is nothing more than a conditional formality. Something that we tell each other to show care and politeness. 
  - On nights like the one I’m describing,music isn’t for listening—it’s for silencing. The soft hum in my ears blurred the outside world, making it easier to stay within my thoughts. I kept the volume low, not out of courtesy, but caution. If I couldn’t hear what was behind me, how could I know I was alone? The music wasn’t always entertainment—it was armor.
  - Two blocks from home, I saw a shadow on the ground that wasn’t mine. I paused my music. The sound of footsteps emerged behind me—soft, steady, and wrong. I didn’t look, but my pace quickened. Someone was there. My hands curled into fists inside my pockets, and my chest tightened. I was no longer walking alone.
  - What does it mean to feel unsafe? Sometimes it’s not a monster—it’s a pace behind you that matches yours. It’s the feeling of being watched or followed. I felt the cold metal of my house keys in my pocket and gripped onto them. Every footstep from behind felt louder than my own heartbeat.  “Get home safe.”
  - Then—nothing. No footsteps, no shadows. Just stillness so thick it made my ears ring. I looked once, twice. The street was bare. Empty pavement. Nothing was there. And yet, the feeling in my chest did not subside. Was that real? What happened? 
  - I turned the final corner and saw my house waiting at the end of the block. My hand tightened harder around the key, leaving a red indent mark in my palm. Even on the doorstep, I checked behind me one more time. The street was still empty, but the unease remained. I stepped inside, locked the door, and stood still in the dark hallway. I was home safe—for now
