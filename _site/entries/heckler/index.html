      <p>So I’m licking on this crumb, right, like I’m absolutely dogging down on it, you know. Didn’t even expect to find it, just fell into the bag and went with it, started hunting, and there it was. Big and crusty,  practically begging me to come and unfold my tongue and just let ‘er rip. Always the best, the unexpected ones. Always the best. What? Oh yeah, so I’m licking on the crumb and I see her drop in too, and— swing a left here, yeah. Take those stairs up. We’re almost there —anyway, I see her drop in and I’m thinking to myself, like, you’ve got to be kidding me. Anywhere, she could be anywhere, and she needs to gloss her wings in this bag? In this cavernous bag? With my crumb? You’ve got to be kidding me. Completely took me out of my enjoyment of the thing. Ruined my high—
Ayeee, Douglass! Hop in our swarm, man. You headed to Big Light, too? Yeah, long day at work. You know. Window washing today. My tongue gets tired from licking on the glass for that many hours but, what can you do? Gotta make money, gotta earn my keep. I’m never one to turn down a check. There’s something about being entirely self-sufficient that just…It keeps me going, man. But I hate to be all motivational. Nothing like going out and having that one guy start preaching. You know I was never religious; parents didn’t live long enough to take me to church. Oh no, no, don’t say sorry. We’re all in the same boat. All in the same boat. I just like to keep it light, that’s all. Might do stand-up.
So, guys, where was I? Right. Lorraine. So she’s in the bag with me, and she’s all like, “What are you doing here?” And I’m like, “I was here first, bitch,” and then she looks at me like I’m the crazy one, even though I was clearly already hamming it up in that bag with that crumb. Women. Can’t live with ‘em, can’t live without ‘em. Am I right? Okay, I hear you, calling her a bitch was probably too far. Yeah, yeah, people make mistakes. I hope she doesn’t call me, that bitch. Sorry, couldn’t help myself. Anyone know if she’s gonna be there tonight?
Okay, zip around this corner now, and then it’ll be under that door. I haven’t been, no. But my memory is fine as an artisanal wine, baby. Peter gave me the directions earlier, and I just saved ‘em right up in the ol’ noggin. No effort necessary.
Woooof, this slit is thin! Maybe that crumb was a bad idea. Gotta start thinking about my summer bod. I can’t wait to get out of this damn house, man. It’s nice and all, these people leave shit everywhere to eat, right, plenty of jobs, but nothing compares to a sip of beer from a can sitting on the arm of a plastic pool chair. You know what I’m saying, dude, you know what I’m saying! Man, and the fruit. Hohohoooo. Can’t get fruit like that in these months. Watermelon. Oh, man, I’m salivating at the thought. Practically levitating. Oh, wait, I am! Ah, never gets old. Right up there, yeah. You seeing this? Bright as the sun. I bet it’s toasty in there. If Lorraine shows up, dude, I swear. I don’t even know what I’ll do. You’ll have to hold me back or something.
Yooo, James, Patrick, Louis, I had no idea you guys would be here! Great to see you, great to see you. Haven’t had to venture to the basement much these days, glad to see y’all are managing okay down there. Hasn’t taken away that lust for life, has it? Oh, great to hear it. Always happy to see my guys. Aye, easy on the wings, man, I gotta stay sharp. Never know who might show up. Don’t even mention her name, bro. Alright, lets head in, show ‘em what Mark and the Gang are bringing to the function! That’s what I’m talking about.
So what we having, boys? Place is bumping. I like that. Always like a crowded lamp. And this lightbulb is superb, might I add. Great heat coming off of it. Need that to unwind after a long day. I’m feeling like letting loose. Been so long. Oh, I see some High Noon cans on the desk out there. Stay here, don’t worry, I’ll grab some for y’all, too. How much you guys having? 3 drops each? Go big or go home, man! That’s what I’m saying, man. Okay, I’ll be right back.
ZzzzZZzZZZZzzzzZz…Grapefruit, pineapple…I’m thinking citrus tonight. Gotta gather these onto my back, love a successful harvest. Can’t get enough. ZZZZzzzzzzzzzZZZZzzz. Man, I love this song.
Okay, boys, I got us grapefruit. Here, everyone grab a sip — yeah, from my back is fine, we’re all friends here! Woooooohooo. Yup. That’s strong. That’s good. That’s nectar, man. Reminds me of the frat days. Remember those? Yuuup. Woooow. Yeah that’s hittin fast tonight, man, its been so long, haven’t had any in so long, ZZZZZZZzZZZZ. Man, this is my SONG! C’mon, let’s dance.
Nothin like stretchin my wings, movin my legs. Loveit, ‘oveit Mmmmhm. Yo they got a fruit girl? Why ‘idn’t anyone mention that before? ‘Oulda come sooner. WOOOW that ‘as strong. You feelin it, man? Imma check out this fruit. I think that’s a cherry. Wow. Ripe. You see this? You gonna come? Suit yourself, man. Can’t be a bad thing, gotta be something the club offers. I’m just gonna head out for a sec, stick my head out.
Mmmmf that is one plump cherry. I can practically taste the juice already. Imma just…imma just settle myself on the pit right ‘ere. Aye. What? Yo. I can feel that. Yo. Nah! Hell nah! ZZZZZZZZZZZ ZZZ ZZZZZZ, bitch! ZZZZ! Can’t catch me, moving slow as hell. You try, but you can’t get the Mark! The Mark! No one’s ever killed me! ZZZZZZZZzzzzZZZzzZZZZ, yeah, that’s right. You try, but I dodge. I duck. I move quick, nimble. You move in slow motion. I’m gonna get that cherry, imma get it. Don’t tempt me with a good time. Yeah, you thought you knew where I was. You’re in the wrong corner, while I’m taking your food. zzzZZZ. Haha. ZzZz. Gluggluggluglgulgulgulggluglugluglug SMACK.</p>
